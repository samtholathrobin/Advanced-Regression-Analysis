# Advanced-Regression-Analysis
This is an attempt to learn regression in depth by exploring the various techniques for regression on the housing prices dataset. 
In this project I explored multiple regression techniques from basic linear regression to ensemble methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting techniques
like XGBoost and Cat Boost and even Deep learning ANNs.
Out of all of these the Cat Boost Regressor performed the best, providing us the best RMSE score.
